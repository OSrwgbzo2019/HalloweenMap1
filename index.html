In 2011 a 17th century cottage was discovered by water engineers during construction work and is believed to have belonged to one of the Pendle witches. Pendle Hill remains full of mystery and is truly bewitching to visit. </h6>

A blue boy used to apparently haunt the Pink Room in the castle with guests seeing blue flashes and a halo above their beds after a loud wail. The skeleton of a boy wearing blue clothes was then discovered during renovation works. Other ghosts reportedly include an injured soldier who lives in the Castle’s torture chamber, and a Spanish witch whose curse brings bad luck to those who steal from the castle. </h6>

The Gothic setting of the abbey ruin overlooking the North Sea inspired Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula which featured the creature coming ashore as a large dog and climbing the 199 steps up to the ruins. You can still reach the abbey by climbing those steps today. </h6>
